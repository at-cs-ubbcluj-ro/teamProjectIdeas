Ideas
1. Tv/Car embedded surveillance.
 - Hidden camera on a tv/car.
 - Detects when powered on outside of a defined geofence and used by an unknown person.
 - Capture on demand/automatically images on predefined actions.
 - Uploads the captured pictures to the cloud/server.
2. Outdoor/Indoor surveillance.
 - Detects familiar/unknown persons.
 - Capture on demand/automatically images on predefined actions.
 - Uploads the captured pictures to the cloud/server.
 - Send notifications to the configured recipients.
3. Garage door automation.
 - Detects automatically the license plate and opens the garage door.
 - Uploads logs with the activity.
 - Present the activity logs over time.
 - Send notifications to the configured recipients.
4. Water level surveillance/monitoring.
 - Send notifications if detects water over a certain level.
 - Capture the current levels.
 - Present historical data over time.
 - Send notifications to the configured recipients.
5. Air quality monitoring.
 - Notify automatically when the configured threshold values are hit.
 - Capture the current levels.
 - Present historical data over time.
 - Send notifications with the current values to the configured recipients.
6. Apidictor.
 - An apidictor is an instrument which measures and records the sound in a beehive. The instrument records the aggregate sound made by the buzzing of the bees' wings. They were thought to be useful for predicting when a colony is preparing to swarm. E.F. Wood invented and patented the apidictor in 1964.
 - Using TensorFlow, train a model with two microphones, one attached to the hive to capture the hive activity and the other to capture the outside noise. After recording for a few seconds, eliminate the outside noise, the app should be able to draw a conclusion if the hive is preparing to swarm or not.

7. Noise level monitoring.
 - Detects automatically if the max threshold level was reached.
 - Sends alerts to the configured user.
 - Define separate threshold values for different time intervals.
8. Road condition detection.
 - Detects automatically the road conditions, like normal, wet, muddy, covered by leaves, etc.

9. Road sign detection.
 - Detects road signs like stop, speed limit, etc.

10. Mood detection.
 - Train using TensorFlow a model capable of recognizing the moods of a person.
 - Define actions based on the detected mood.

11. Estimate the number of persons in a room.
 - Using the video feed or static images detect the number of persons in a room.
 - Train the model using TensorFlow.
 - Record the values over time.
 - Present historical data over time.
